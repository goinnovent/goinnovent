The 4C Summit is a three-day incentive event for the top beef and dairy customers of Elanco and Micro Technologies. It reflects the attendeesâ€™ goal of creating an environment where participants can form collaborations with leaders from industries beyond their own. They explore how other industries face challenges and make connections to apply different approaches to their traditional ways of doing business. Attendees commit their time annually by participating in the 4C Summit with the goal of finding new ideas to transform their business models. Over the course of the three days, customers and their spouses gain valuable knowledge from inside and outside industry speakers, participate in pre-planned local activities of their choice and enjoy elegant dinner receptions.

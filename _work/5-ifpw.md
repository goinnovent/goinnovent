The IFPW CEO Roundtable is a two-day event that occurs annually in a different location around the world. Itâ€™s an assembly of Chief Executives of wholesaler and national distribution association members of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers (IFPW) to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing the global pharmaceutical industry and distribution sector.
IFPW's membership is comprised of over 40 of the largest and most influential full-line wholesalers in the global pharmaceutical supply chain. These large, complex organizations from 19 countries are involved in pharmaceutical distribution, pharmaceutical retailing and a wide range of healthcare services. Manufacturers, especially biotech and specialty, reap the benefits of these specialized services.
The event includes a high-end networking reception and dinner, as well as a valuable and interactive general session where attendees discuss opportunities and challenges they face.

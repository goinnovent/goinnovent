ThinkForward is an invite-only event that brings together 100 of AmerisourceBergenâ€™s Millennial associates for two days to explore how the millennial generation is shaping their organization. The associates are chosen through an extensive selection process that includes a look at performance ratings, diversity across geography, ethnicity, gender, life experiences and business units, as well as other factors. ThinkForward is the perfect setting to allow associates to engage with peers and organizational leadership in an effort to foster common understanding as the organization moves forward as a leading employment destination for the millennial workforce.

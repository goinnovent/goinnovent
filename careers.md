### Engagement Coordinator

Innovent is seeking an Engagement Coordinator to support our rapidly growing team. The Engagement Coordinator will be responsible for conceptualizing and leading strategic client programs, driving the planning process and executing successful events. The Engagement Coordinator will report to both Engagement Managers and Senior Engagement Managers.

The Engagement Coordinator’s key responsible will include:

- Implementing the event strategy
- Infusing the event messaging architecture

**What we do:**

Innovent creates experiences that move our clients’ business forward.

Innovent fixes this issue with proactive and comprehensive services that have been proven successful time and time again.

For an event to be successful, it’s essential to have a well-thought out and
objective-focused roadmap. This roadmap is connective from the time the event
conceives until long after the last attendee departs. This tactical approach creates a stronger connection between your brand and attendees, and is what we refer to as an event continuum.

We create events that connect brands to audiences in powerful ways. Every service
we offer throughout the event continuum roadmap is uniquely designed to deliver a seamless and integrated story and ultimately, maximize ROI.

**Requirements:**

- Four-year college degree in graphic design or related field
- Salary, benefits, and why you’ll love working at Innovent.

**Competitive Salary**

- Flexible paid time off policy

- Be a part of a team that is transforming the way our clients are bringing their brand to life.

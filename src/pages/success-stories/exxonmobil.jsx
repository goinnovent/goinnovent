        For years, ExxonMobilâ€™s Annual stakeholder meeting repurposed the event
        branding and venue, limiting their ability to instill confidence in the
        positive impact ExxonMobil makes in the world. The goal was to create a
        visually motivating event brand. They challenged us to combine two
        established meetings with separate audiences all while creating a
        tech-forward, innovative theme. To do this, we recommended a venue
        change to magnify the Keynote address and bring their brand to life.
        This new enviornment allowed us to create an innovative stage design and
        take advantage of the opportunity to showcase their brand throughout the
        space.

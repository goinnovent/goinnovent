        The AVIA Network Summit attracts 40+ of the largest, most
        forward-thinking health systems in the country. In its third year, the
        AVIA Network Summit created a singular focus on the outsized impact of
        digital. The goal was to bring together practical perspectives on how
        health systems could incorporate digital in every aspect of their
        organizations.

        Innovent created opportunities for meaningful face-to-face engagement by
        designing a partner expo and producing an impactful general session.
        Innovent partnered with AVIA to develop main stage presentations that
        conveyed ways they addressed consumerism, caring for vulnerable
        populations, and sustainably improving operational efficiency.

        Parexelâ€™s first-ever Global Leadership and Sales Summit Meeting brought
        leaders and sales teams from all over the world together to Dallas,
        Texas. Their objective was to celebrate their accomplishments, address
        challenges, and share ideas for accelerating their growth in 2020.
        Parexel partnered with Innovent to manage the event space planning,
        design and execute the EXPO, and oversee general session production.
        <br /> <br />
        We took Parexel's new brand identity and determined a strategic approach
        to bring their message to the forefront of every visual opportunity.
        Through the event dress, app, general session, opening night reception,
        and EXPO, we infused their voice to inspire their leaders and create a
        lasting first impression.
